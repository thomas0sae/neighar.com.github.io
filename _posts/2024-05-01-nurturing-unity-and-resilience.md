Introduction:
 
400 Neighborhoods Launched... Thousands More to Come!

On November 17th, we introduced [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download)'s availability nationwide.

The response from neighbors nationwide has exceeded our expectations, reflecting a widespread eagerness to revitalize community bonds. We're delighted to facilitate this movement.

To date, we've initiated over 400 neighborhoods across 40 states.

And this is just the beginning. Thousands of neighbors have initiated the process of launching [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) websites for their own communities.

As we witness the rapid expansion of [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) across neighborhoods, we're reminded of the profound impact that genuine connections can have on our lives. Through shared experiences, mutual support, and collective action, communities thrive and flourish. [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) serves as the catalyst for this transformation, providing a digital platform where neighbors can come together, interact, and collaborate for the betterment of their neighborhoods.

We're excited to see this momentum continue to grow as more neighbors join the [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) family, sparking positive change and creating lasting bonds within their neighborhoods.
