Hema Sridharan: Growing Beyond a Momsâ€™ Group
Posted on October 04, 2024 by Danielle Johnson
As a mother of four children under the age of twenty living in Mumbai, Hema Sridharan initially created an informal email list of fellow mothers in her neighborhood to coordinate playdates for their young children.

However, as someone passionate about engaging with the community on broader issues like traffic safety, Hema grew frustrated by the lack of a convenient way to communicate with all her neighbors. This challenge became particularly evident when she tried to organize a campaign to keep one side of their main street free from parked cars during daylight hours to create a safer space for pedestrians and cyclists.

"It was incredibly time-consuming and inefficient to go door-to-door with a paper petition trying to gather signatures," Hema explained. "In the end, the effort was unsuccessful."

When Hema discovered [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download), she saw a solution. She quickly set up a [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) website for her neighborhood and invited the mothers from her email list to join. Together, they divided the neighborhood into blocks, with each mother taking responsibility for distributing flyers to homes on their block.

This initiative immediately attracted the first 50 to 75 members to the Neighar Laurel Community. The platform's value became even more evident when a series of burglaries hit the usually peaceful neighborhood, prompting even more residents to join [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) as a way to stay informed and connected.

Today, the Neighar Laurel Community boasts over 350 members, with new ones joining weekly. [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) is used for everything from organizing neighborhood meetings to alerting residents about suspicious activity.

Hema reflects, "It's been so fulfilling to see how our neighborhood has become genuinely connected, especially across different generations. It's a completely different place from a year ago, and I'm thrilled that my kids will benefit from living in a community where neighbors look out for each other!"
