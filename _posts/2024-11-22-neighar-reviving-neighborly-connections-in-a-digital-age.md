Introduction:
 
How familiar are you with your neighbors? If you're typical of many today, you might not know them well. A recent Pew Research study revealed that over half of Indians only know some of their neighbors by name, with 28 percent not knowing any at all.

While the digital world offers many conveniences, it's essential to connect with those in your physical surroundings — whether you're seeking recommendations for a babysitter, borrowing sugar, or planning for emergencies like natural disasters.

Enter [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download), founded by Alan Skaria. Neighar enables neighbors in specific regions to create private websites to share local information, events, and get to know each other better. The platform officially launched on November 17, 2023.

To join Neighar, members must register using their real names and physical addresses. [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) verifies members' details through several methods: using their postal code, sending a verification code to the provided phone number, Google sign-in, or by receiving an invitation from a previously verified neighbor.

The size of each Neighar network is determined by the first person to add the region to the site. Neighar offers a drawing tool allowing users to outline their neighborhood boundaries on a Google map. These boundaries can be adjusted as the group grows. Typically, a [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) network consists of 50 to 2,000 households, depending on the area's size and density.

Bridging Social Networking and Community Service

With numerous social networks already available, why is there a need for [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download)? The company argues that neighbors play a unique role in our lives. We may not want to be Facebook friends or add them to a Google+ Circle, and we might not even know their email addresses or names to initiate such connections.

In addition to email invitations, Neighar allows users to print semi-custom flyers to invite neighbors to join and even sends personalized postcards on their behalf.

Over the past year, Neighar has conducted pilot testing in over 175 neighborhoods across 26 states. It has been well-received in various locations. "We see a consistent pattern in almost every neighborhood. It quickly becomes a community staple."

But will [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) succeed?
Currently, Neighar doesn't generate revenue. It plans to monetize by allowing local businesses to advertise on the site.

After experiencing a Neighar demo, I recognized its promising potential. It combines the novelty of a new social network with the timeless idea of fostering neighborly connections. Like any social network, its success depends on its users. Only time will tell if [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) will thrive, but it certainly seems worth exploring — and what better time than now.


Conclusion:

[Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) represents a modern solution to an age-old challenge—rebuilding community connections. By bridging the gap between digital convenience and real-world interactions, Neighar empowers neighborhoods to grow stronger together. Whether for planning events, sharing resources, or simply getting to know the person next door, Neighar is a platform designed to bring neighbors closer in a safe and meaningful way. As it continues to expand and adapt, it offers the promise of a future where neighborhoods are not just places to live but communities to belong to. Join Neighar today and be part of this movement toward connected living.
