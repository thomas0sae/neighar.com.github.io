Introduction:
 
Many people have grown so accustomed to using global social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter that they may have overlooked a gap in their local social connections – their neighbors.

Research from the Research Center indicates that more than half of Indians either don't know any or know only a few of their neighbors by name. [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download), led by co-founder Alan Skaria, aims to address this modern social challenge. Skaria notes, "We view neighborhoods as untapped social networks, a chance to rekindle something often lost in today's digital age. While technology makes it effortless to connect with people globally, it seems to falter when we try to connect with those right outside our front door."

After a year of development, Neighar discreetly rolled out its free online platform in late November. The platform enables users to create private, localized networks within their neighborhoods. Prioritizing safety, security, and genuine privacy, [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) only allows verified neighbors to join each user-created neighborhood group.

To register for a free account, users must complete an application, verify their identity, and confirm their residence on the designated street. They then have fifteen days to recruit a minimum of ten neighbors for group approval. Once established, the group can grow organically by adding new neighbors.

The platform's interface is reminiscent of Facebook and features a map for defining neighborhood boundaries. The system is most effective for groups comprising 100 to around 1,000 neighbors.

The mapping technology enables neighbors to decide whether they want to display parcel and building outlines with real names and house numbers. Members can opt to withhold specific details until trust is established.

Early adopters of Neighar primarily engage in neighborly activities such as finding babysitters, locating lost pets, or borrowing tools.

[Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) is accessible nationwide, and within five weeks of its launch, it had been adopted by 550 neighborhoods across 40 states. The platform allows users to flag inappropriate posts for prompt review.

The prerequisite for a group to include at least ten people who already know each other likely sets a tone that influences the behavior of new members. The Neighar team has observed increased sales for local businesses through the platform, suggesting a potential future business model centered on connecting businesses with nearby residents.


Conclusion:

In a world where global connections often overshadow local bonds, [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) provides a refreshing opportunity to reconnect with those who live closest to us. By fostering secure, private, and localized networks, Neighar transforms neighborhoods into vibrant communities of trust and collaboration. With its thoughtful design and emphasis on safety, it’s not just a platform but a step towards rebuilding the social fabric of our neighborhoods. Join Neighar today and discover the power of knowing your neighbors!
