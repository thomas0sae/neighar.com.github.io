Introduction:

Is there room for another online social network? The creators of [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) believe there is.

Launched on November 17, 2023, [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) aims to revolutionize social networking by focusing on connecting neighbors through private, neighborhood-specific networks. Given that a Pew Internet study found that 57 percent of Indians either know only some or none of their neighbors' names, [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download)'s concept seems timely and relevant.

While similar ideas have been explored before, such as Zillow's 2007 "Neighborhood Pages" and Zaarly's neighborhood-centric person-to-person selling platform, [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) offers a unique approach.

The platform is designed to enhance community bonds by providing features like a neighborhood directory where residents can match faces with names. It also includes recommendation boards where neighbors can share trusted referrals for services like plumbers, babysitters, or restaurants. These recommendations are intelligently organized, categorized, and archived, serving as a valuable community resource over time.

Security and trust are paramount for [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download). Members are required to use their real names and undergo verification before joining a neighborhood. Verification methods include a confirmation code sent to a mailing address, a code sent to a provided phone number, or a recommendation from an existing verified member. While these measures may make joining a bit more challenging, [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download)'s team believes they are essential for building trust within the network.

[Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) also prioritizes user privacy by using HTTPS and robust password security. The platform commits to never sharing user information with advertisers.

To establish a neighborhood on [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download), users must input their postal code, which is then verified to confirm their neighborhood. These details can be updated later if needed.

Since its launch, [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) has been adopted in approximately 200 neighborhoods across 26 states, ranging in size from 50 to 2000 households. With its innovative approach to neighborhood networking, [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) is poised to reshape how neighbors connect and interact online.
