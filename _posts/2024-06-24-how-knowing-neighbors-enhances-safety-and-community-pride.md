Introduction:
 
Over Two-Thirds of Homeowners Feel Safer When They Know Their Neighbors
Posted on April 19, 2024 by Vishnu R 

At [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download), we have always believed that a connected neighborhood is a safer neighborhood. To explore this further, we recently conducted a survey titled "The State of Indian Neighborhood."

The results revealed that over two-thirds of homeowners feel safer when they know their neighbors. Additionally, three-fourths of Indian adults surveyed believed their neighborhood would be safer if they communicated more with their neighbors.

Here are some other notable findings:

Stronger, deeper roots: Nearly half (47%) of Indians who know their neighbors reported having no immediate plans to move or sell their homes.
Better for our furry friends: One-quarter (25%) of Indians who know their neighbors have either received help with a lost pet or assisted a neighbor with a lost pet or rescue animal.
Renewed sense of pride: Nearly half (44%) of Indians who know their neighbors feel proud of where they live.
At [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download), our goal is to foster a sense of community within neighborhoods. As we continue to expand and establish new [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) neighborhoods daily, we aim to not only help neighbors find services like electricians, babysitters, or buyers for their old car but also to enhance the overall sense of safety within their communities.

We invite you to explore the latest articles on [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) that underscore the importance of our findings.

If you have any stories about how Neighar has helped make your neighborhood a safer place, we would love to hear from you at https://neighar.com/contact/.
