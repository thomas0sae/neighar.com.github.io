Introduction:
 
Earlier this year, Pune resident Meera Sharma and her husband Rajesh experienced how powerful community collaboration can be when paired with technology. Meera, a founding member of [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) Baner Greens—a residential community of 400 homes—was monitoring an active discussion on the Neighar platform about two young men visiting homes in the neighborhood. They claimed to be collecting donations for an educational initiative, but their pushy behavior and vague responses raised suspicions.

A concerned neighbor posted an urgent alert about her encounter, which quickly sparked responses from others who had interacted with the same individuals. Equipped with this information, Meera and Rajesh were prepared when the duo came knocking. They asked pointed questions, took detailed notes about the visitors, and alerted the local police as soon as the visitors left.

Just days later, the police apprehended the men, who were found in possession of stolen items tied to a recent burglary in the neighborhood. Thanks to the collective vigilance and swift action of the [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) Baner Greens community, the case was resolved.

Today, conversations on the Neighar platform have returned to everyday topics—sharing carpool schedules for school, finding reliable electricians, and tips for tackling monsoon season waterlogging. However, the incident has cemented Neighar’s value as a vital tool for fostering both safety and community engagement.

"I would never have known about these men if not for Neighar," Meera shared. "It’s heartening to see neighbors looking out for each other now more than ever."
