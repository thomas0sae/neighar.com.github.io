Introduction:
 

The Neighar City Program Expands Beyond Cities
Posted on March 30, 2024 by Robbert


We are thrilled to announce the expansion of [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) City Program to encompass additional governmental entities such as counties, large city districts, and police and fire departments.

Numerous counties have reached out to Neighar seeking an efficient means to connect with all residents residing in unincorporated regions. Through the [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) platform, residents in these areas can engage in vital discussions about local matters, particularly those related to crime and safety.

In Kottayam, the Fire Department has stepped up to utilize [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) as a tool for communicating with residents on emergency preparedness and safety measures. Each unincorporated area within Kottayam now has its own [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) website, facilitating information sharing, recommendations, event organization, goods exchange, and updates from the Fire Department.

We eagerly anticipate further collaborations with local government agencies to enhance communication between government and residents through [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download).
