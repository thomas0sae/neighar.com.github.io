Authored by Rebecca Neighar on March 12, 2024

As a member of [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download)'s NOPS team and a user of the platform, I am keenly aware of the ongoing discussions surrounding privacy concerns in today's social network landscape. This issue can be intricate because while social networks serve as valuable tools for connecting with others, there is a delicate balance between sharing personal information with chosen contacts and safeguarding one's privacy. At [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download), we are unwaveringly committed to addressing this concern.

What sets [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) apart from other social networks is its foundation built to complement one of the oldest and most essential real-world social networks: your neighborhood. Consequently, our application facilitates interactions akin to those you would have with your neighbors in person. We advocate for sharing only what you would feel comfortable sharing with those in your immediate vicinity.

[Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) invests considerable time, effort, and resources to ensure our application provides a safe environment for sharing online, mirroring the interactions you'd have with your neighbors face-to-face.

Here's how we do it:

- Content shared is visible only to you and your neighbors.
- Every neighbor must verify their address.
- Each neighbor authenticates using their real name, mirroring real-life interactions.
- Account access is protected by passwords.
- We do not disclose your information to advertisers.

Privacy, safety, and security are our top priorities at [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download).
