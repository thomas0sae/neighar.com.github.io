Neighar Engineering Blog
Posted on April 15, 2024 by Sancho John


At [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download), our engineering team has been dedicated to developing features that aim to strengthen and secure our communities. However, we also want to take moments to share our progress with you. Today, we are excited to announce that we are making one of our internal development tools, git-change, available to the open-source community.

Recognizing that much of our communication will be highly technical, we have created a new blog specifically for [Neighar](https://neighar.com/get-neighar) engineering news. To read today's announcement about our newly released development tool and to stay updated on other engineering developments, visit the [Neighar](https://neighar.com/blog) Engineering Blog.
