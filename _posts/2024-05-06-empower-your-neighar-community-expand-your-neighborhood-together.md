Introduction:
 

Fire up your [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) site by signing up new neighbors
Posted on January 15, 2024 by Thomas (Neighar)

Through our experience, we've observed that the more individuals join a [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) neighborhood, the more vibrant, engaged, and beneficial the site becomes for all. The most efficient way to expand your [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) neighborhood is by inviting your neighbors*. By doing so, your neighbors can promptly authenticate their accounts by joining through your invitation.

We've recently introduced the capability to swiftly send text message invitations directly from your Message application. While joining a [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) neighborhood typically requires email verification, we understand that obtaining email addresses for all your neighbors may not always be feasible.

For instances where email addresses are unavailable, here are some additional methods to spread the word:

Print out flyers and carry them with you:
Residents have shared with us that printing flyers beforehand and keeping them handy while you're out and about in the neighborhood is effective.

Send referral invitations to acquaintances:
Each neighbor has the ability to extend referral invitations to friends and family. We've found that the best recipients for referral code invitations are individuals you know personally or your closest neighbors.

Include a personalized message in your invitations:
Regardless of the invitation method chosen, including a personalized message can significantly enhance its effectiveness. Neighbors are more likely to engage with your invitation if it includes a friendly introduction to why you utilize [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) in your neighborhood.

Feel free to get creative in spreading the word. Mention [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) at your school's PTA meeting, during neighborhood watch gatherings, or garner support from your HOA.

If you have any insights or tips regarding inviting your neighbors, we'd love to hear from you. Share your success stories by emailing us at https://neighar.com/contact/.

Thanks,
