Introduction:
 
Connect with More of Your Neighbors
Posted on November 14, 2024 by David Peter

We're excited to announce the launch of our Nearby Neighborhoods feature, designed to make connecting with neighbors in surrounding areas easier than ever. With this new addition, you can now extend your conversations beyond your immediate neighborhood to share valuable information with nearby communities.

Many [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) members have expressed interest in engaging with neighboring areas. By expanding your reach, you can foster more dynamic discussions and build stronger connections across a broader audience.

Key Benefits of Nearby Neighborhoods:

Service Recommendations: Reach more people when seeking or offering recommendations for local services.
Wider Sales Listings: Sell items to a larger group of neighbors, increasing your chances of a successful transaction.
Community Alerts: Share alerts about safety concerns or suspicious activities to protect a broader area.
Your Privacy Is Our Priority:
You control when and if you share posts with surrounding neighborhoods. Your personal profile information remains private and is visible only within your own community. If you prefer, you can continue to engage solely with your local neighborhood.

Using the Feature:

Select which neighborhoods will receive your post.
View a map showing the neighborhoods near you.
Read messages shared by neighbors in other communities.
Adjust your settings for notifications about nearby neighborhood activity.
For more detailed instructions, check out the FAQ section. As always, we’d love to hear your thoughts! Send any feedback or questions to feedback@neighar.com.

Thank you for being an essential part of the [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) community!

Best regards,
David Peter
VP of Product, Neighar
