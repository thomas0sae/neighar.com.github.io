Introduction:
 
Several startups, have tried to create social networks for neighborhoods and communities, but none have become the go-to platform for local neighborhood groups. Now, [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download), co-founded by Alan Skaria, seeks to address this gap in the social networking landscape.

Neighar, a private social network designed for neighborhoods, was officially launched on November 17, 2023, following a year of private beta testing. The platform enables neighbors to establish private websites similar to Facebook specifically for their local communities. Users can participate in discussions, pose questions, share local advice and recommendations, spanning various topics from community events and school fundraisers to service suggestions and updates on recent crime activity.

Privacy stands as a cornerstone feature of [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download), with all neighborhoods being private and necessitating address verification for membership. The platform utilizes a stringent verification process for members, which includes sending unique code postcards, phone number validation, Google sign-in, and email confirmation. Data shared on Neighar is password-protected, remains inaccessible to individuals outside the neighborhood, and is not indexed by search engines.

Using community maps, users can identify which neighbors have joined, access a directory of residents, and engage with updates either via email or the website. Neighar serves as a tool to link neighborhoods and communities, providing a private communication platform for local residents.

[Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) was designed from scratch to facilitate connections among neighbors within a trusted setting. During its testing phase, Neighar garnered positive feedback, engaging users across more than 175 neighborhoods in 26 states.

[Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) is redefining how neighbors connect by offering a secure, private, and purpose-built platform for local communities. With its robust privacy measures and user-friendly features, it fosters meaningful neighborhood interactions, from sharing advice to staying informed about community updates.
