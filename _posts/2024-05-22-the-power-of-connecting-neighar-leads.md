When Leads Connect, Good Things Happen
Posted on April 12, 2024 by Kishore

[Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) Leads mark their neighborhood locations.

On Tuesday, April 4th, over 60 Leads from various cities gathered at our Ernakulam office. This event was a fantastic opportunity for Leads to network, learn more about [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download), and provide valuable feedback to our team.

The diversity of the Leads' neighborhood communities was truly inspiring. They discussed the challenges of bringing their neighborhoods online for the first time, fostering community in areas where it was previously lacking, and ensuring that online interactions remain relevant and respectful. Despite the differences in their communities, all Leads shared a common goal: to make their neighborhoods safer, stronger, and more connected.

We are incredibly grateful to those who attended, as their feedback is essential in helping us improve [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) daily. We look forward to hosting more events like this in the future and hope you can join us!
