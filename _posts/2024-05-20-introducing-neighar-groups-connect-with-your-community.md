Announcement: Introducing Neighar Groups
Posted on April 10, 2024 by David John

We're thrilled to introduce a highly requested feature: the ability to create groups within [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) neighborhood websites. Now, all [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) members can establish groups to connect with others who share common interests or activities.

Here are examples of some frequently requested groups:

- Parents
- HOA boards
- Neighborhood Watch
- Dog owners
- Neighborhood improvement committees

Two Group Types

Members can create two types of groups: public and private.

Public groups: Ideal for opening up communication to all [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) neighbors. Posts, membership, and the option to join are visible to all members.
Private groups: For sharing information exclusively with selected members. Only group members can view the group roster and posted content. Approval by the group moderator is required for membership.
Creating a Group

Any member can initiate a group. To create groups in your neighborhood, visit your neighborhood’s group page or click on the ‘Groups’ link at the top of any [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) website page. For further details on group functionality, please consult our Groups FAQ.

The introduction of groups is a direct response to feedback from our [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) Leads. We extend our gratitude to all who participated in the beta testing, contributing valuable feedback. We trust this feature will facilitate seamless information sharing among you and your neighbors. As always, we eagerly anticipate your continued feedback.


Best Regards,

David John
VP of Products
