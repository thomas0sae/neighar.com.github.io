Introduction:

When you catch a whiff of smoke or hear sirens and want to understand the situation, when you need to borrow a ladder, or when you're curious about why a local store closed down, the people who can assist you are right around the corner. The challenge lies in connecting with them.

Even for someone like me, who tends to keep to themselves, it's clear that there are local social opportunities beyond deals and check-ins, presenting a promising area for social web and app development.

On November 17, 2023, a startup named [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) launched a verified network of social networks tailored for neighborhoods. The platform is practical and specifically designed to nurture small, private communities.

[Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) CEO Alan Skaria described his platform to me in this way: You have Facebook for connecting with friends and family, LinkedIn for your professional network, and Twitter for your interests. But what about your local community?

[Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) itself resembles Facebook's initial approach, which required student users to authenticate using their .edu email addresses and still mandates real names. The [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) platform aims to be a secure space for sharing personal information with a relevant, small audience, verifying users' residency in a neighborhood through postal codes and phone listings.

However, one might question the extent to which you'd want to share your identity with neighbors. And is it practical to rely on a platform like [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) reaching a critical mass before you can communicate with people just down the street?

Alan believes that real identities aren't crucial for sharing local information such as event announcements, apartment listings, and lost and found items. Additionally, he argues that concerns about maintaining privacy regarding local information are somewhat misguided. "People aren't interested in pretending to be in neighborhoods they're not part of because the content isn't relevant," he noted.

Alan is of the opinion that a successful local social network should begin on mobile devices to serve as a resource when people are out and about in their neighborhoods.

Perhaps, if all goes according to plan, users of these local social networks may eventually put down their phones and engage in face-to-face conversations.

Conclusion:

In an era dominated by global social networks, [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) stands out by focusing on the local connections that matter most. Founded on the principle that neighborhoods are untapped social networks, [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) offers a platform where residents can share information, seek assistance, and foster a sense of community. While some may question the extent to which personal identities should be shared with neighbors online, [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download)'s emphasis on relevancy and localized content aims to alleviate these concerns. CEO Alan Skaria's vision for a mobile-first approach underscores the platform's commitment to being a valuable resource for people while they are out and about in their communities. As [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) continues to grow and connect neighborhoods across the country, it holds the potential to redefine how we engage with those who live right next door, paving the way for more meaningful local interactions both online and offline.
