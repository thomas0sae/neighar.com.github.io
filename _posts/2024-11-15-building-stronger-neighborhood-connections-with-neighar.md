Introduction:
 
Platforms such as Facebook and Google have made it easy for us to stay connected with family, friends, and even followers. Yet, this convenience often creates a disconnect from those we interact with in our daily lives—our neighbors. How well do you actually know the people living next door?

In India, only about 43% of people are familiar with some or all of their neighbors by name. The remaining 57% barely know or don’t know any of their neighbors at all. [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download), a new social networking platform, aims to bridge this gap between our digital lives and the local community around us.

Neighar provides free, private neighborhood platforms, making it simple for residents to connect with one another. Whether you need a recommendation for a reliable repair service, information on local events, or help locating a lost pet, Neighar enables neighbors to stay in touch and share essential updates about their area.

Joining your local [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) network is easy. Just enter your email and physical address on the platform to find out if there's already an active group in your neighborhood. If not, you can be the one to initiate it. Neighar is ideal for:

Community organizers
Parents involved with local schools
Neighbors who actively participate in local events
If you're passionate about bringing your community together, you could become a founding member of your neighborhood’s [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) group. Even if you're not ready to start one yourself, you can check back periodically until a network forms in your area.

To ensure safety and authenticity, Neighar verifies each user’s identity. New members must provide their name and address, which are verified through a code sent via email or phone, or through an invitation from an existing verified member.

Once you're verified, [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) offers a range of tools, such as a neighborhood directory, local maps, events calendars, a marketplace, and service recommendations. Users can control how much information is displayed on their profiles, choosing whether to share details like their email address, phone number, or just their street name.

Would you consider joining Neighar? It offers a unique opportunity to get to know your neighbors better and to foster a sense of community in our increasingly digital world. Unlike other platforms, [Neighar](https://neighar.com/download) helps us focus on our local surroundings, making our neighborhoods a little more connected.
