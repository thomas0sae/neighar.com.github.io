EmwaveTech believes there is a need for a new social network, and the India-based company has launched its private social network designed for neighborhoods across the Indian Sub-continent. After many months of successful testing in several neighborhoods spanning 29 states, Neighar plans to expand aggressively in the future.

Founder and CEO of Neighar emphasizes the lack of a social network exclusively dedicated to Indian Villages, which he considers one of the most crucial communities in India's lives. The uniqueness of this network lies in its focus on connecting individuals solely based on their villages and neighborhoods. To join, users must have their locations verified by Neighar. Once inside, they can access a map displaying local land plots and profiles of neighbors who have also joined. The platform's appearance combines elements of several other prominent applications and social media apps.

Neighar serves as a platform for neighbors to ask questions, exchange recommendations for services like mechanics or drivers, or post notices about where they get better services and food. Additionally, users can promote sales of and list items for sale. The underlying concept is to create a secure and trusted network of local individuals, differentiating itself from other platforms like olx, where interactions often involve strangers from far away places. Neighar and its investors highlight the company's commitment to stringent privacy measures.

Although the service is not available in many cities yet, those interested in bringing it to their area can visit Neighar.com and request a site for their neighborhood. The company's current focus is not on profitability, with plans to eventually incorporate advertising and facilitate connections to local business deals.

"We want to grow this thing fairly large first," says Neighar's CEO, viewing Neighar as a viable alternative to Facebook, with several successful transactions already taking place on the platform.
